## What It Does

### Chatbot Interaction
- User can type messages, and the bot responds in chat.
- The bot reads out loud what it says using text-to-speech.
- Responses are animated to simulate typing.

### Task Assistant Features
- User can add tasks with natural language like:  
  `"Add task: Update antivirus in 3 days"`  
  `"Remind me to enable 2FA"`
- It allows user to:
  - View a list of tasks
  - Mark tasks as completed
  - Delete tasks if needed
- Each task includes a title, reminder date, and status.

### GUI
- I built the GUI in WPF.
- It includes:
  - dark-themed chat
  - scrollable history
  - Input box and "Send" button at the bottom
